    <h1>Level Design Patterns</h1>

    <p>A level design pattern is a repeating configuration (of space and logic)
    which can be found again and again in video games. They are valuable and used
    repeatedly for a variety of reasons especially due to their predictable effect
    on the players behaviours.</p>

    <p>There are other collections of level design patterns, e.g. some part of a
    thesis or for specific genre of game. Level design patterns from those other
    sources are also included here.</p>
