This is a database of level design patterns.
A level design pattern is a repeating configuration of space which can be found again and again in video games.
They are valuable and used repeatedly because of some predicatable effect on the players of the game.

<p>
    Hosted on github https://github.com/LevelDesignPatterns/ the raw data is available. Get in touch if you want to help.
    There are other collections of level design patterns, I've included patterns from those other sources to put all the data in one place.
