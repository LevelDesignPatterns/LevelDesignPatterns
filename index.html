    This is a database of level design patterns.
    A level design pattern is a repeating configuration of space which can be found again and again in video games.
    They are valuable and used repeatedly because of some predicatable effect on the players of the game.

    I originally started to collect game patterns back in the mid 2000s when employed at A2M (now BHVR).
    This list was generated as part of the game level design course I wrote and teach at UWE in UK.

<p>
    Hosted on github the raw data is available. Get in touch if you want to contribute.

<p>
    There are other collections of level design patterns, I've included patterns from those other sources to put all the data in one place.
