<p> A level design pattern is a repeating configuration (of space and logic)
which can be found again and again in video games. They are valuable and used
repeatedly because of some predicatable effect on the players of the game.</p>

<p> Game Design Patterns are not Level Design Patterns.Though the reverse could
be said to be true.</p>

<p>Hosted on github <a href = "https://github.com/LevelDesignPatterns/">
https://github.com/LevelDesignPatterns/</a> the raw data is
available. Get in touch if you want to help.</p>

<p>There are other collections of level design patterns,e.g. some part of a thesis
or for specific genre of game. Level design patterns from those other sources
are also included here.</p>
